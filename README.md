# Animated Burger Button Project

This project showcases an interactive, animated burger menu button created using HTML and CSS. It's a fun and engaging way to integrate a menu button on your website, especially for mobile navigation. The burger button consists of various layers, each representing a part of a burger, and it animates upon user interaction.

## How It Works

The animation effects are achieved purely through CSS. Each part of the burger (bun, lettuce, tomato, pickles, cheese, and patty) is represented by `<span>` elements styled with CSS to look like a burger. The `:hover`, `:focus`, and `:active` pseudo-classes are used to trigger animations when the user interacts with the button.

### CSS Breakdown

- **Custom Properties (`:root`)**: Defines color variables for easy theme customization.
- **Animations**: Various keyframes and transitions are used to animate the burger components:
  - **Buns**: Rotate and move slightly to mimic the top bun being lifted.
  - **Lettuce**: Waves gently to give a dynamic feel.
  - **Tomato**: Wiggles to create a lively interaction.
  - **Pickles**: Move sideways, simulating a slide.
  - **Cheese**: Melts down, changing shape to appear more fluid.
  - **Patty**: Sizzles with a wiggle effect.

## Features

- **Pure CSS for Animation**: Leverages CSS animations and transitions for a smooth and visually appealing effect.
- **Responsive and Customizable**: The button's size and colors can easily be adjusted using CSS variables.
- **Interactive Elements**: User interaction with the button triggers delightful animations, enhancing the user experience.
